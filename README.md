# ML-Resilience-of-the-PUF-Circuit
Leveraging algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree and KNN we attempt to model the circuit's behavior. The primary metric of interest is the prediction accuracy, which will later be used to assess the vulnerability of the Arbiter circuit to ML attacks.
